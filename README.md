A dynamic website programmed in php.

Key points I used in this website:

#### CSS:
- responsive navigation bar
- flex-box that can align elements in the same div

#### PHP:
- dynamically generate the web contents
- access the database and execute queries
- create a backend functionality
- export a file in csv format (in backend newsletter manage)
